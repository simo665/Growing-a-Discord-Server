           <h2 style="color:#ffffff;">Note:</h2>
           <p>This guide was created by <a href="https://gist.github.com/jagrosh" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; color: #e8eb50; text-decoration: underline;">Jagrosh</a> and is available in his public GitHub repository. I find his guides incredibly helpful for growing a server, and after using it myself, I thought it would be great to share it with my friends here on this site.</p>
           A basic server template is available <a href="https://discord.new/DMDbu354ZcNf">here</a>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm jagrosh#4824! I'm writing this guide to try to help new server owners set up and grow their servers, which is a commonly-requested topic. It's very easy to go about this the wrong way, so it's best to be prepared and make smart decisions so that your community can flourish!</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>You might be wondering: why am I qualified to write this guide? Excellent question! Well, I've created several successful Discord servers, including the <a href="https://discord.gg/monsterhunter">Monster Hunter Gathering Hall</a> (120,000+ members, game community), a bot support server (7,000+ members), and two bot community servers (<a href="https://discord.gg/9nbTNQU">100,000+ members</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/qVGuRaR">50,000+ members</a>). I also help moderate several large servers, and I am a Discord partner. Finally, I am very familiar with the technical aspects of Discord, which are useful for setting up servers and permissions.</p>

            <h2>Part 1: Should I make a server?</h2>
            <p>This is an important question. Just because you <em>can</em> make a server doesn't mean you <em>should</em>. When you're making your server, make sure to ask yourself these questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Is this something that you are passionate about?</strong> Don't make a server just for the sake of making one. You should be highly interested in the topic and want to improve the community for that topic. You should also be knowledgeable about the topic and able to help newcomers and experienced members alike.</li>
                <li><strong>Does this server have one specific topic?</strong> If your server is a "generic gaming server" or "generic public server" or "random server" or "memes" or any variation, then it is not going to grow.</li>
                <li><strong>Do any other servers for this topic exist?</strong> If a server for your topic already exists, you should join the existing server instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Does the topic benefit from having a Discord server?</strong> Discord is great for real-time communication via text and voice.</li>
                <li><strong>Do you need to own the server?</strong> Would you be willing to give ownership to someone else if it meant that the community would grow better?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 2: Setting up the server</h2>
            <p><em>This section is still in-progress and should just be used as a basic guide.</em> Click <strong><a href="https://discord.new/DMDbu354ZcNf">here</a></strong> for a basic template that you can use as a starting point!</p>
            
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>The key to good channel structure is keeping important information easy to find, and categorizing everything as appropriate. An example of a structure for a "Minecraft Redstone" server might be:</p>
            <pre class="channel-structure">
‚åµ Information
   # rules
   # announcements
   # contests
‚åµ General
   # lobby
   # off-topic
   üîä Voice
‚åµ Projects
   # survival_redstone
   # creative_redstone
   # command_blocks
   # map_sharing
‚åµ Mods
   # mod_chat
   # mod_log</pre>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Channel Order</strong> - Keep the 'rules' or 'info' channels near the top; remember that when someone first joins the server, they'll see whatever the first visible channel is (unless the invite they join points somewhere else)!</li>
                <li><strong>Invites</strong> - I normally don't give people the 'Create Instant Invite' permission via role, and instead create a manual override allowing it only for the 'rules' channel. This means that if someone wants to invite their friend to the server, the friend will see the rules channel first!</li>
                <li><strong>NSFW Channels</strong> - A good rule of thumb is: don't. There _is_ a reason why you might want to create a NSFW channel, and that reason is if the core topic of the server has a NSFW component. For example, some television shows have scenes that might be not appropriate for underage viewers; a NSFW channel would be useful for discussions about these scenes. *Don't make a NSFW channel if it doesn't relate specifically to the server*.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Roles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Member Roles</strong> - "Member" roles (or equivalent) can be useful if you want members to agree to a set of rules (usually via a bot command) or if you want to check out people before manually giving them the role and letting them join the server. <em><strong>DO NOT</strong> have a bot give every single new member a role right when they join.</em> Why? Giving everyone a role prevents some of Discord's useful features from being possible. The most important is the Verification Level. For large servers, it is important to make sure that all users have verified accounts (linked an e-mail to their account) to avoid spam and raids. However, the server's Verification Level does not apply to anyone with a role, so if you give everyone a role when they join, you are essentially setting your server Verification Level to "None" and leaving yourself wide open to all kinds of attacks. Additionally, the "Prune Members" feature becomes useless as you cannot prune members with roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Staff/Mod Roles</strong> - I often find it useful to have a colorless role that is given to all Staff (regardless of what kind of staff) to keep the sidebar more organized (I make sure the "Display role members separately from online members" is checked for 'Staff' and unchecked for the other roles). Then, each type of staff has a role with a name and color corresponding to the type of staff they are (Moderator, Event Manager, etc).</li>
                <li><strong>Bot Roles</strong> - <em>Never give bots more permissions than they need!!</em> This is extremely important and a mistake that a lot of people make. Remember, if you give a bot a permission, you are effectively giving that permission to _anyone_ with the bot's token. Usually this is just the owner of the bot, but if they are careless and leak their token, it could be anyone. Most bot invite links come with a preset list of permissions, but if you want to add the bot without giving any permissions right away (and giving the permissions manually later), you can remove the `&permissions=NUMBERS` section of the invite link.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Part 3: Advertising</h2>
            <p>Focus on quality over quantity. Attract members who are genuinely interested in your server's topic.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Listing Sites</strong> - Use recommended server listing sites.</li>
                <li><strong>External Outreach</strong> - Connect with related communities.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Spam</strong> - Never spam invites on random servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Involvement</strong> - Be an active community member.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section><h2>Part 4: Tips</h2>
          <p>These are just some generic tips that usually correlate with success.</p>
          <ol>
              <li><strong>Don't separate the "Owner" in the member sidebar.</strong> Usually, a role should only be "displayed separately" or "hoisted" if people need to be able to easily see who is in that role. For example, it's usually good to hoist "Moderators" so that someone can easily ping them if needed. However, hoisting roles like "Owner" just looks narcissistic. It is also very rare for someone to need to speak to the owner rather than a moderator. If you trust your moderators (which you should), then you can trust them to redirect a user to you if contacting the owner is actually necessary.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't use any kind of "levels" or "exp" system.</strong> Don't give points or award roles for chatting. This is the quickest and easiest way to drown out any real conversation. People are much more engaged in a community if everyone who is talking is talking because they are interested in the server, not just because they want points. If you are having trouble keeping people engaged, hold events that relate to the topic! Also, keep in mind that "having a role" is not an incentive for people to talk. If someone just wants a role, they could just join some other server that gives them one. Make your server stand out by having real and relevant conversation, and then you don't need to incentivize people to talk!</li>
              <li><strong>Only have as many moderators as the server needs.</strong> It might be tempting to start adding a bunch of moderators as soon as there is some activity, or as soon as the first bad thing happens, but don't be too quick. Make sure that you completely and fully trust your moderators before adding them, and don't add too many. Early on, you probably only need one or two mods just to make sure that you have all timezones covered. A decent estimate for moderator counts is 1 mod per 1000 members, and 1 admin per 10 mods. This varies a <em>lot</em> based on the nature of the server, of course.</li>
              <li><strong>Do not advertise to random people, nor on random servers, nor reward people for inviting friends.</strong> Unsolicited advertising breaks Discord's <a href="https://discordapp.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>, so if you send random invites, or even have a system that encourages people to do that, you're breaking the ToS and your server and/or account could be shut down! Follow the rules!</li>
              <li><strong>Think about why <em>YOU</em> would want to join a server.</strong> Don't follow certain practices or add certain things just because you saw someone else do it; do things because they make your server something you want to be a part of! This is something that so many servers mess up; they add bots or certain channels just because they saw another server with them and not because it actually makes the server more enjoyable.</li>
          </ol>

                        <li><a href="https://invite.gg">invite.gg</a> - This site is great for getting a customized invite link that can easily distinguish your server.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.discordservers.com/">discordservers.com</a> - This is likely the most popular listing site, and allows you to provide a small description about your server. This is very useful when people are searching for the topic of your server.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.carbonitex.net/discord/servers">carbonitex.net</a> - Carbonitex is great for keeping various stats about your server, including members, activity, and messages. The list here is also often used to rank servers by member count.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://blargbot.xyz/">blargbot</a> - This bot can be used to customize your server in almost any way you can imagine. It has a strong custom command implementation that lets you make whatever commands your server is going to need. It can log messages and record moderation actions, and even have some basic automoderation if needed.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/jagrosh/Vortex/wiki">Vortex</a> - This is a basic moderation and auto-moderation bot. It doesn't require any setup for the basic commands (using native Discord permissions for its checks), and it's easy to set up some basic auto-moderation for preventing spam, advertisements, and raids.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://auttaja.io/">Auttaja</a> - Commonly used for its 'gatekeeper' functionality, which can help with mitigating problem-users from entering your server in the first place.</li>

                        <li><a href="https://discord.bots.gg/bots/298822483060981760">Logger</a> - Logger has the capability to log pretty much anything you'd want to in a consistent format.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://blargbot.xyz/">blargbot</a> - Similar to its moderation capabilities, it can be used to provide information to your users. You can make it announce joins or leaves, or make tags for common topics.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://discord.bots.gg/bots/80528701850124288">R. Danny</a> - Lots of utilities such as tags & reminders; consider this an alternative option for some of the bots already listed.</li>

                    <h3>Game Bots</h3>
                    <p>Probably not a good idea. You don't need any game bots. Most game bots are public bots that any server can add, and they don't help _your_ server stick out from the crowd. Additionally, these bots are almost never related to the topic of the server, and rarely provide constructive and meaningful conversation related to the topic of the server. The one exception to this suggestion would be to have a custom-built game bot that relates directly to the topic of your server.</p>
